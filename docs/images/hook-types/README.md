## Geometric Characteristics

### Machine Hook
- **Manufacturing**: Bend 3/4 of a coil out
- **Geometry**: Hook loop plane contains spring axis
- **Strength**: Stronger than crossover (smaller bend radius)
- **Usage**: Most common, general applications

### Cross Over Center Hook
- **Manufacturing**: Lift last coil + twist toward center
- **Geometry**: Hook loop plane contains spring axis, larger bend radius
- **Strength**: Slightly weaker than machine hook
- **Usage**: Second most common

### Side Hook
- **Manufacturing**: Simply bend last coil out
- **Geometry**: Hook on one side, spring body offset
- **Cost**: More economical than crossover
- **Usage**: When spring body must not interfere with mechanism

### Extended Hook
- **Manufacturing**: Like side hook with extended leg
- **Geometry**: Long hook, short body length
- **Cost**: Most expensive
- **Usage**: Long length inside hooks with short body, more force from fewer coils
